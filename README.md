PeacePlayers Email Sender
This is a Python script that allows users to send personalized emails to a list of recipients in a CSV file. The script uses the smtplib library to send emails via Gmail's SMTP server, and the tkinter library to create a simple GUI for the user to interact with.

Getting Started
To use this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Next, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start the script, navigate to the directory where you saved the script files and run the following command:

Copy code
python email_sender.py
This will launch the GUI window. Follow the steps below to send emails:

Click the "Browse" button and select the CSV file containing the email list.
Click the "Send Emails" button to start sending emails.
The status of each email will be displayed in the "Email Status" box.
Click the "Cancel" button at any time to stop sending emails.
Click the "Clear Display" button to clear the contents of the "Email Status" box.
